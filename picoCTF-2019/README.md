## World's largest Hacking competition

picoCTF is a free computer security game targeted at middle and high school students, created by security experts at Carnegie Mellon University. The game consists of a series of challenges centered around a unique storyline where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, or do whatever it takes to solve the challenge. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent, legal way to get hands-on experience.

The 2019 competition was held between September 27, 2019 and October 11, 2019. Though the competition has ended this year, anyone 13 and older can play picoCTF 2019 or picoCTF 2018 year-round for fun and learning.
