# Open-to-admins - Points: 200

## Problem

> This secure website allows users to access the flag only if they are **admin** and if the **time** is exactly 1400. ```https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/37878/``` ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/37878/)) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:37878

## Hints

> Can cookies help you to get the flag?

## Overview

They give you a website with a big button that leads you to ```/flag``` directory. However, the system will check for something as it doesn't work in the first attempt.

Looking at the bold admin and time with the hint of using cookies. Actually, that's pretty obvious.

## Solutions

I used an [online browser extension](http://www.editthiscookie.com/) for this actually and it worked just fine. I added the 2 new cookies for our target website, the first one is named as ```admin``` with the ```true``` boolean value and the next one is ```time``` with the value of ```1400```. 

Now you just need to click the button once again. The flag will then be printed..

flag:
```
picoCTF{0p3n_t0_adm1n5_2e8d3883}
```
