# la cifra de - Points: 200

## Problem

I found this cipher in an old book. Can you figure out what it says? Connect with ```nc 2019shell1.picoctf.com 12254```.

## Hints

> There are tools that make this easy.

> Perhaps looking at history will help

## Overview

In this challenge, we are given the following domain and port.
```
2019shell1.picoctf.com:12254
```

Let's try connecting to it via TCP.
```

It looks like this is a kind of cipher, specifically ```substitution cipher```, and looking at this part```...hgqqpohzCZK{m311a50_0x_a1rn3x3_h1ah3xf653pdkh}``` . This is probably where the flag is.

## Solutions
Let's see if it's actually Caesar or not, because Ceasar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. However, ```pohzCZK``` cannot be shifted anyhow to become ```picoCTF``` because there are ```p``` and ```C``` in the correct positions already as you can see.

This makes me wanna try another common substitution cipher which is Vigenere cipher, but this particular cipher needs a key to be decoded. Therefore, I'll use a [really great online tool](https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver) to guess.

Choose the language to be English, and you're good to go

﻿It is interesting how in history people often receive credit for things they did not create

During the course of history, the Vigenère Cipher has been reinvented many times

It was falsely attributed to Blaise de Vigenère as it was originally described in 1553 by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his book La cifra del. Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso

For the implementation of this cipher a table is formed by sliding the lower half of an ordinary alphabet for an apparently random number of places with respect to the upper halfpicoCTF{b311a50_0r_v1gn3r3_c1ph3ra653edec}

The first well-documented description of a polyalphabetic cipher however, was made around 1467 by Leon Battista Alberti.

The Vigenère Cipher is therefore sometimes called the Alberti Disc or Alberti Cipher.

In 1508, Johannes Trithemius invented the so-called tabula recta (a matrix of shifted alphabets) that would later be a critical component of the Vigenère Cipher.

Bellaso’s second booklet appeared in 1555 as a continuation of the first. The lower halves of the alphabets are now shifted regularly, but the alphabets and the index letters are mixed by means of a mnemonic key phrase, which can be different with each correspondent.
