## Problem

> You're going to need to know how to run programs if you're going to get out of here. Navigate to /problems/practice-run-1_0_62b61488e896645ebff9b6c97d0e775e on the shell server and run this [program](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/6eba3b66e7a2b786c6c9769711d85663/run_this) to receive a flag.

## Hints

> How do you execute a program in a command line?

## Overview

It's an ELF file as I expected
```
$ file run_this
run_this: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=49eb1de8...
```
You need to run this file on a Unix-based system to get the flag. Simple as that.

## Solutions

```
$ ./run_this 
picoCTF{g3t_r3adY_2_r3v3r53}
```
