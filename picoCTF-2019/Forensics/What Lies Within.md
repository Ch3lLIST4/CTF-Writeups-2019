> Theres something in the [building](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/aec3861fc4d5bce4d39dc0db196426de/buildings.png). Can you retrieve the flag?

## Hints

> There is data encoded somewhere, there might be an online decoder

## Overview

On this challenge, they give us the image file which has png extension without any clear extra information. I guess it could be stegnography. 

## Solutions

I tried to run ```zsteg``` on the file and as I expected, it's just a basic ```LSB``` (Least Significant Bit) technique which hides secret information using the lowest bits in the series of numbers in binary.

```
$ zsteg buildings.png
