## Hints

> Try and script this, it'll save you alot of time

## Overview

Obviously when you take a look inside of the tar file, you'll notice that there's another tar which named as ```999.tar```. The file might be nested a thousand times.   

## Solutions

For doing this challenge, I built myself a simple bash shell script.

```
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1000..1}
do
   tar -xvf $i.tar
   rm $i.tar
done
```

After running the script, the flag file which is the image file ```flag.png``` is revealed.

flag:
```
picoCTF{l0t5_0f_TAR5}
```
